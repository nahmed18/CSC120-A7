- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

My intial impressions of how inheritance affected my programming was that it made a lot of sense and I feel like it made the programming easier. I was able to understand the structure/the hierarchy of the objects and therefore able to understand where the methods and my code was coming from better. Especially when finding functions that were under the child class that I was using. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked was creating the constructor and setting up the methods for each class. As well as testing, out the classes to ensure that they work. What didn't work for me at first was setting up some of the methods because I hadn't realized that the interface had been updated until after I began coding so I ran into a lot of confusion there. Advice I would give to someone taking the course is really understand the logic and the ideas of the programming and don't worry so much about the coding itself because throughout the course you will learn so much more about Java and become a good programmer!
